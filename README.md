The Mirror: HTML Promotional Email

The Mirror is an HTML email project put together to practice implementing an E-Commerce design from start to finish. 

I was inspired to code this project as a daily practice idea. From doing so I have learned a lot about my own speed and productivity working without frameworks. 

In this project I utilized Photoshop, VSCode, and Litmus/Putsmail.
